### If you're looking for the compiled (.jar) version of the plugin:
You might be a little lost. Check out our [Beta Releases on GitHub](https://github.com/JIBSIL/synex-coin/releases) or stable releases on [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/synex-coin-add-real-crypto-to-your-minecraft-server.101696/).

# synex plugin
SynexCoin Spigot Plugin

Developed and tested on Spigot v1.18.2  
SQLite and JDBC (MySQL) support.  
Vault support.  
Uses [solanaj](https://github.com/lmvdz/solanaj) for Solana Mint/AssociatedTokenAccount SPL support.  

## Installation  

Download the latest `.jar` build from [build/libs](https://github.com/lmvdz/synex/tree/master/build/libs).  
Add to your `plugins` directory.  
Start the server and edit the `plugins/synex/config.yml` file.  

To be able to use the `/synex:export` command you'll need a valid `signer` private key.  
You'll want to make sure the `publicKey` corresponds to the `signer` private key (base58 encoded).  
`tokenMint` is defaulted to [Synex Coin Token](https://solscan.io/token/FTkj421DxbS1wajE74J34BJ5a1o9ccA97PkK6mYq9hNQ).  
By default, the database is set to use sqlite and has been tested with MySQL.  
  
If you need help converting your Uint8Array private key to base58 there are a few methods.  
1. Use Phantom wallet, Add/Connect wallet, import private key, and paste the Uint8Array. Open the wallet, go to the settings, scroll down and export the private key.  
3. Use NodeJS [Uint8Array to Base58 gist](https://gist.github.com/Xavier59/b0b216f003b8e54db53c39397e98cd70).
